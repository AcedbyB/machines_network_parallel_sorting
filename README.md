Parallel sorting on a network of machines

Note:

Right now, in node01 and node02, we have an executable of gensort that could be used to generate samples. Read usage here: http://www.ordinal.com/gensort.html
The file, along with some generated data files (10K, 1_million, 100_millions), is in ~/localdisk/parallel_sorting
